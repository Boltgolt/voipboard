# voipboard

Viopboard can add a soundboard to **any** VoIP application, on **any** Linux distribution that uses Pulseaudio. (such as Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint and openSUSE) Utilizing the Pulseauido `pactl` command, Viopboard will add the sound effects to your default output and VoIP input. The soundboard itself is controlled by a local website, so _in theory_ everyone in the chat can use it.
